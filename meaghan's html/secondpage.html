        <p><h1>HALLOWEEN STORY</h1></p>
        <p>
            Daisy was so excited to harvest her pumpkins and carve jack o' lanterns. Halloween was her favorite time of year. She had to restrain herself from hanging up decorations in <i>August</i>, and she handmade her costume every year by September 1st.<br>

            So of course when autumn rolled around once more, Daisy ran out into the garden with garden gloves and pruners.<br>
            But when she got to the garden... her pumpkins were gone!!!!<br>

            Daisy narrowed her eyes. Who had stolen her pumpkins?<br>
            She looked high (even on the roof) and low (even in the irrigation ditch).<br>
            <img src="story high and low.png" height = '200' width = '250'/><br>
            Alas, she found zero (0) pumpkins.<br>
            But then..................<br>
            she found a large cave.<br>
            <img src="story into the pumpkin.png" height = '200' width = '250'/><br>
            "I don't remember this cave!" she said. "Maybe my pumpkins rolled down here!"<br>
            She couldn't have been more wrong.<br>
            <img src="story the end.png" height = '200' width = '250'/><br>
